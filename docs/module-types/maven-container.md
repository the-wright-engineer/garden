# `maven-container` Module Type

A specialized version of the [container](https://docs.garden.io/module-types/container) module type
that has special semantics for JAR files built with Maven.

Rather than build the JAR inside the container (or in a multi-stage build) this plugin runs `mvn package`
ahead of building the container, which tends to be much more performant, especially when building locally
with a warm artifact cache.

A default Dockerfile is also provided for convenience, but you may override it by including one in the module
directory.

To use it, make sure to add the `maven-container` provider to your project configuration.
The provider will automatically fetch and cache Maven and the appropriate OpenJDK version ahead of building.

## Reference

Below is the schema reference. For an introduction to configuring Garden modules, please look at our [Configuration
guide](../guides/configuration-files.md).

The [first section](#complete-yaml-schema) contains the complete YAML schema, and the [second section](#configuration-keys) describes each schema key.

`maven-container` modules also export values that are available in template strings. See the [Outputs](#outputs) section below for details.

### Complete YAML Schema

The values in the schema below are the default values.

```yaml
# The schema version of this module's config (currently not used).
apiVersion: garden.io/v0

kind: Module

# The type of this module.

# Set this to `true` to disable the module. You can use this with conditional template strings to disable modules
# based on, for example, the current environment or other variables (e.g. `disabled: \${environment.name == "prod"}`).
# This can be handy when you only need certain modules for specific environments, e.g. only for development.
#
# Disabling a module means that any services, tasks and tests contained in it will not be deployed or run. It also
# means that the module is not built _unless_ it is declared as a build dependency by another enabled module (in which
# case building this module is necessary for the dependant to be built).
#
# If you disable the module, and its services, tasks or tests are referenced as _runtime_ dependencies, Garden will
# automatically ignore those dependency declarations. Note however that template strings referencing the module's
# service or task outputs (i.e. runtime outputs) will fail to resolve when the module is disabled, so you need to make
# sure to provide alternate values for those if you're using them, using conditional expressions.
disabled: false

#
# Note that you can also _exclude_ files using the `exclude` field or by placing `.gardenignore` files in your source
# tree, which use the same format as `.gitignore` files. See the [Configuration Files

```

#### `description`

A description of the module.

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| `string` | No       |

#### `disabled`

Set this to `true` to disable the module. You can use this with conditional template strings to disable modules based on, for example, the current environment or other variables (e.g. `disabled: \${environment.name == "prod"}`). This can be handy when you only need certain modules for specific environments, e.g. only for development.

Disabling a module means that any services, tasks and tests contained in it will not be deployed or run. It also means that the module is not built _unless_ it is declared as a build dependency by another enabled module (in which case building this module is necessary for the dependant to be built).

If you disable the module, and its services, tasks or tests are referenced as _runtime_ dependencies, Garden will automatically ignore those dependency declarations. Note however that template strings referencing the module's service or task outputs (i.e. runtime outputs) will fail to resolve when the module is disabled, so you need to make sure to provide alternate values for those if you're using them, using conditional expressions.

| Type      | Default | Required |
| --------- | ------- | -------- |
| `boolean` | `false` | No       |

#### `include[]`

Specify a list of POSIX-style paths or globs that should be regarded as the source files for this module. Files that do *not* match these paths or globs are excluded when computing the version of the module, when responding to filesystem watch events, and when staging builds.

Note that you can also _exclude_ files using the `exclude` field or by placing `.gardenignore` files in your source tree, which use the same format as `.gitignore` files. See the [Configuration Files guide](https://docs.garden.io/guides/configuration-files#including-excluding-files-and-directories) for details.

Also note that specifying an empty list here means _no sources_ should be included.

| Type               | Required |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| `array[posixPath]` | No       |

Example:

```yaml
include:
  - Dockerfile
  - my-app.js
```

#### `exclude[]`

Specify a list of POSIX-style paths or glob patterns that should be excluded from the module. Files that match these paths or globs are excluded when computing the version of the module, when responding to filesystem watch events, and when staging builds.

Note that you can also explicitly _include_ files using the `include` field. If you also specify the `include` field, the files/patterns specified here are filtered from the files matched by `include`. See the [Configuration Files guide](https://docs.garden.io/guides/configuration-files#including-excluding-files-and-directories)for details.

Unlike the `modules.exclude` field in the project config, the filters here have _no effect_ on which files and directories are watched for changes. Use the project `modules.exclude` field to affect those, if you have large directories that should not be watched for changes.

| Type               | Required |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| `array[posixPath]` | No       |

| `array[string]` | `[]`    | No       |

#### `services[].disabled`

[services](#services) > disabled

Set this to `true` to disable the service. You can use this with conditional template strings to enable/disable services based on, for example, the current environment or other variables (e.g. `enabled: \${environment.name != "prod"}`). This can be handy when you only need certain services for specific environments, e.g. only for development.

Disabling a service means that it will not be deployed, and will also be ignored if it is declared as a runtime dependency for another service, test or task.

Note however that template strings referencing the service's outputs (i.e. runtime outputs) will fail to resolve when the service is disabled, so you need to make sure to provide alternate values for those if you're using them, using conditional expressions.

The port exposed on the container by the running process. This will also be the default value for `servicePort`.
This is the port you would expose in your Dockerfile and that your process listens on. This is commonly a non-priviledged port like 8080 for security reasons.
The service port maps to the container port:
`servicePort:80 -> containerPort:8080 -> process:8080`

This allows you to call the service from the outside by the node's IP address and the port number set in this field.

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| `number` | No       |

#### `services[].replicas`

[services](#services) > replicas
